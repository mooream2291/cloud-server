# LAB - Class 16

## Project: Project  AWS cloud-server

### Author: Ashley Moore

### Process:

Lena, Jeremy, Dina, and Brai spent a total of 3-4 hours helping me troubleshoot a still unknown error that messed my terminal, had to update brew, reinstall some things, read a lot of documention and just keep breaking things until it worked. This went nothing like how the lab directions descibed.
